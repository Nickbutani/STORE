The database used in this project is XAMPP. 

You will need to install the XAMPP in order to get the working login page. 
  1. Install the Xampp
  2. Create new database, name it "login_system"
  3. Create new table name it "users"
  4. Import the users.sql to table.
This will create you database. You will need to change you username and password for your database.

Product storage in this project is temporary, so if you go back or refeash it will remove item from cart.
